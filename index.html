            <p>Waves in the electromagnetic spectrum can travel many millions of light years.</p>
            <p>Waves on the ocean can circle the earth.</p>
            <p>Their power is never lost but is absorbed by other energy systems.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the waves of our global communications can carry powerful messages.</p>
            <p>How we as humans absorb these messages is key to both our growth as a species and our lasting peace.</p>
            <p>We cannot be in phase with all of the 7 billion plus ideas on how we should live.</p>
            <p>Neither should we blindly align ourselves with one powerful idea.  History shows this to be disastrous.</p>
            <p>Democracy is not perfect but the consensus rules.  Dangerous minority views are restricted and positive minority views are tolerated, encouraged and celebrated.</p>
            <p>We will not stabilize our society by rejecting and discrediting ideas just because they are not our own.</p>
            <p>We can confront opinions with our own arguments but must also accept that we are often wrong and have to compromise.</p>
            <p>We can learn to try to understand differing ideas, accept the reasons behind them and that they are as valid as our own.</p>
            <p>We can discuss and debate them in a tolerant and open minded way.</p>
            <p>Global Game Jam has shown how diverse, talented and interesting people can come together, accept each other and work in union.</p>
            <p>We can pool our ideas, skills and efforts and make something wonderful that did not exist before.</p>
            <p>It's not easy; ideas and views change constantly, but with open minds and open hearts...</p>
            <p>...we can all be on the same wave.</p>
